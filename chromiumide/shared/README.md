**NOTE**: This directory is currently for doing some exploratory work and its structure is subject
to change. Please continue committing your code in the /src directory unless you are joining the
research.

# Shared

This directory contains the source code and configurations we use in both internal IDE and VSCode.

The code in /src can depend on the modules in this directory, but not vice versa. (TODO(oka): Add
linter check)
